Q1: Consider the ZK proof for graph 3-coloring.
What if the prover doesn't permute the colors in every iteration?
That is, the prover permutes the colors once in the beginning 
and then sticks to that permutation for all iterations. 
Will the protocol still be zero-knowledge?

then it will not be zero-knowledge
let vertex set be V = {v_1, ..., v_n}
edge set be E
com be a commitment scheme
forall i in n, c_i = com(v_i, color of v_i)
since after verifier pick edge e_{i, j} in E and send e_{i, j} to prover
prover need to open c_i and c_j
if same permutation is used for all iterations
then information might be derived from opening c_i and c_j

Q2: Consider the multiple party computation protocol which we just saw.
Suppose that the first and third student are colluding.
Show that they can compute the age of the second student.

let random number offset be r, 3 students be s1, s2, s3 with age a1, a2, a3
s1 computes r + a1
s2 computes r + a1 + a2
s3 computes r + a1 + a2 + a3
if s1 collude with s3, r + a1 is known from s1, a3 is known by s3, and r + a1 + a2 + a3 is also known by s3
then (r + a1 + a2 + a3) - (r + a1) - a3 = a2
