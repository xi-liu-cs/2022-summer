end to end (e2e) security
how can we a have a system
such that the system do not know what msg is

extended triple diffie hellman (x3dh) protocol
new key derived from old key

forward secrecy
k_1 -> k_2 -> ... -> k_n
knowing key k_i do not allow decipher of previous keys

identity key - associated with device
signed prekey - generated during installation and changed periodically
ephemeral one-time prekeys - lasts for one session
(should be destroyed every time a new sender requests one)

1. sender a receives all public keys of recipient b from server
2. derive master key using
  b's public keys
  a's id key + ephemeral key
3. sends a header with a's id key, ephemeral key, b's prekey identifiers
and initial msg encrypted with master secret
4. b calculates master secret

double ratchet protocol
k_1 -> k_2 -> ... k_i ... -> k_n

sha (256 = num bits)

root -> chain -> msg
