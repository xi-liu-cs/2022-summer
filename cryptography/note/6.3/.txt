secret sharing: multiple people together to reconstruct a secret
in a (t, n) secret scheme, 'n' users each with piece of puzzle
secret is successfully reconstructed only if at least 't' users come together

n = 10, t = 3
1 person have 10 sons
instead give map of treasure
give a piece of map to each person
if son >= 3 come together, then can reconstruct map

reconstruct: calculate secret

if(#inputs > t)
  output(treasure location)
else
  output(random location)
  
each of n users have unique key

cloud server storage: 10 users
key value revealed iff users >= 5 come together

2 points sufficient to define a line
3 points sufficient to define a parabola
4 points sufficient to define a cubic curve
k points sufficient to define a polynomial of degree (k - 1)

degree of a polynomial is the highest of the degrees of the polynomial's monomials (individual terms) with non-zero coefficients
for example, the polynomial 7x^{2}y^{3}+4x-9, which can also be written as 7x^{2}y^{3}+4x^{1}y^{0}-9x^{0}y^{0} has three terms
the first term has a degree of 5 (the sum of the powers 2 and 3)
the second term has a degree of 1
and the last term has a degree of 0
so, the polynomial has a degree of 5
