secret sharing: multiple people together to reconstruct a secret
in a (t, n) secret scheme, 'n' users each with piece of puzzle
secret is successfully reconstructed only if at least 't' users come together

n = 10, t = 3
1 person have 10 sons
instead give map of treasure
give a piece of map to each person
if son >= 3 come together, then can reconstruct map

reconstruct: calculate secret

if(#inputs > t)
  output(treasure location)
else
  output(random location)
  
each of n users have unique key

cloud server storage: 10 users
key value revealed iff users >= 5 come together

2 points sufficient to define a line
3 points sufficient to define a parabola
4 points sufficient to define a cubic curve
k points sufficient to define a polynomial of degree (k - 1)

degree of a polynomial is the highest of the degrees of the polynomial's monomials (individual terms) with non-zero coefficients
for example, the polynomial 7x^{2}y^{3}+4x-9, which can also be written as 7x^{2}y^{3}+4x^{1}y^{0}-9x^{0}y^{0} has three terms
the first term has a degree of 5 (the sum of the powers 2 and 3)
the second term has a degree of 1
and the last term has a degree of 0
so, the polynomial has a degree of 5

allow to split a secret s into n parts
so that any subset of at least t is sufficient to reconstruct the secret

t = 3, n = 6
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
a b are rand
c is secret

p1 = (x1, y1)
p2 = (x2, y2)
...
pn = (xn, yn)

6 points are allocated to 6 people
1 point per person
any 3 points given are enough to find secret
p1 = (10, 121)
p2 = (-3, 4)
p3 = (-6, 25)

121 = a(100) + b(10) + c
4 = a(9) + b(-3) + c
25 = a(36) + b(-6) + c

a = 1
b = 2
c = 1

derive an equation from pattern of points
ex: y = 121 = (10 + 1)^2
y = (x + 1)^2
= x^2 + 2x + 1
