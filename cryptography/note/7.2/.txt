given color (r, g, b), assign color to every vertex
2 connected vertices have diff color

if not 3 colorable, at least  edge has same color
1 / m chance of catching
(1 - 1 / m)^{cm} < (1 / e)^c

nondeterministic polynomial
class of problems whose solutions can be verified
efficiently. factoring a number
