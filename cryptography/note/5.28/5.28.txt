caesar with key 3: x, y, z -> a, b, c
vignere with key string 123: helloz -> igomqc

affine cipher 仿射密碼
1. map: a -> 0, ..., z -> 25
2. select a multiplier, choose 7
(multiplier must be coprime with 26)
   select a adder, choose 11
4. reduce each number using mod 26
5. convert each number to corresponding char
key: ac.m7.a11 (m = mult, a = add)

if there is repetition in final row
if repeated val in ciphertext, recipient cannot decrypt
why no repeated val here?
since multiplier is coprime with 26
why coprime avoid repetition? 
since we are dealing with the residue class of Z/26Z and that is our key has to be coprime with 26

c = ciphertext
m = msg, plaintext
k = key

c = enc(m, k)
m = dec(c, k)

if most text start with greeting msg, then a portion of text is known
